<h2>Welcome to pygr!</h2>
			
Pygr is open source software designed to make it easy to do powerful
sequence and comparative genomics analyses, even with extremely large
multi-genome data sets.

pygr includes:

<ul>
<li> Code for interacting with sequence databases, search methods such
as BLAST, repeat-masking, megablast, etc.;

<li> Querying and working with sequence annotation databases and
sequence alignment datasets;

<li> A data namespace for accessing a given resource with seamless data relationship management.

<li> Easy data sharing that includes transparent access over network protocols.

<li> High performance graph representation and query of interval-based data.
</ul>

pygr is available under
the <a href='http://github.com/cjlee112/pygr/raw/master/LICENSE.txt'>New
